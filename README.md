# itil4anki
A deck for Anki - https://apps.ankiweb.net/ - delivering an ITIL 4 FOUNDATION mock exam based on over 100 example questions publicly available on the internet created by use of Ankip Add-On for multiple choice available from https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1566095810.

#### Note: The deck is imported as '.apgk' and it is not clear yet, if it can be managed via PRs. However, I do not plan to invest time into this project, so please rather fork it. I would change my mind, if handlng plain text files for Anki works well.
