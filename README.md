# itil4anki
_This project was created in order to share my output when I was preparing myself for the ITIL 4 Foundation Exam. I was looking for a way to create my own personal ITIl 4 Foundation mock test._

A deck for Anki - https://apps.ankiweb.net/ - delivering an ITIL 4 FOUNDATION mock exam based on over 100 example questions publicly available on the internet created by use of Anki Add-On for multiple choice available from https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1566095810.

If you are planning to complete the ITIL 4 FOUNDATION certification, you could import this deck into Anki and test your knowledge. More questions may be added by me over time. All other ITIL 4 modules (e.g. ITIL MP Specialist: Create, Deliver and Support) may be provided in additional decks to keep things seperated.

#### Note: The deck is imported as binary data as '.apgk' and it cannot be managed via PRs. However, I do not plan to invest time into this project, so please rather fork it. I would change my mind, if handling plain text files for Anki decks works well.

### Disclaimer
I do not take responsiblity for your exam score as I cannot verify 100% that all answers are correct. However, if you find a mistake, just let me know,  I'll fix it asap. The packages are exported w/o any media data (that I may use like stolen images) - please inform me if you think I violated anyone's copyright(s).
